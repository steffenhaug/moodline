* Moodline
A stupid simple package for customizing the Emacs mode line.

[[./docs/demo.png]]

There is basically two features:
1. Customize faces of modeline constructs both in active and inactive window
2. Split modeline in left and right parts

** Installation
As of now, ~moodline~ is under early development, and is not published.
Installation can be done manually by cloning the repository and adding
the repository to the Emacs load path.
