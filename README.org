* Moodline
A stupid simple package for customizing the Emacs mode line.

[[./docs/demo.png]]

There is basically two features:
1. Customize faces of modeline constructs both in active and inactive window
2. Split modeline in left and right parts

Out of the box, the mode line is very similar to the default mode line,
with just the major mode and position of the point moved to the right side,
similar to how it looks in Vim.
There is also a refined Evil state indicator with distinct faces for different states,
which themes can style.

** Installation
As of now, ~moodline~ is under early development, and is not published.
Installation can be done manually by cloning the repository and adding
the repository to the Emacs load path.

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package moodline
    :load-path "~/Code/Emacs/moodline")
#+end_src
